A web app with mobile and browser support for vases.

<b>Usage:</b>

- Initiate XAMP server
- Navigate to main file in localhost (index.html)
- Inspect (for mobile view)

note:   ⚠️ This version contains only the Frontend with mobile support.⚠️ </br>
issues: ⚠️ when viewed on mobile (ios browsers) we experience the [white space issue]()⚠️

<b>How it works:</b>

I didt it from scratch. Navigation first. By this, meaning that screens where created with 
viewport size, stacked next to each other like an array of containers. Floating to the right. 

First container ocupies the main view. Other containers are of viewport boundaries. So, I then
animated it using a combination of javascript and CSS with respective timings. 

I then went to setting the layout for each of the screens according to the design.
